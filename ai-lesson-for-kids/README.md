# AI Lesson for Kids (Age 7-10)

A ready-to-use recipe for teaching AI to elementary school kids in a ~45-minute interactive lesson.

Kids will:
- Discover what AI is (using a paper tic-tac-toe algorithm)
- Train their own image classifier with [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- Generate AI art from their handwritten prompts
- Learn what to watch out for with AI (using Pinocchio, Harry Potter, and The Secret Garden)

Everything appears live on a class website projected on the wall. Kids see their words and images appear in real-time.

```

## Quick Start

1. Set your API keys: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`
2. Copy `assets/template.html` → customize the class name → deploy to Netlify
3. Print the [CS Unplugged "Intelligent Paper"](https://www.cs4fn.org/teachers/activities/intelligentpaper/intelligentpaper.pdf) tic-tac-toe sheet
4. Follow the [lesson plan](references/lesson-plan.md)
5. During class: edit the HTML with kids' input, generate images, redeploy

Full instructions in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## Requirements

- Netlify account (free tier works)
- Gemini API key (for image generation)
- Laptop with webcam + projector
- Paper and pencils for kids' prompts
- ~45 minutes of class time

## Works With or Without Claude Code

This skill is designed for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) using its
**Remote Control** feature — start `claude remote-control` on your laptop, scan the QR code with
your phone, and control the lesson from anywhere in the classroom.

With Claude Code: type instructions from your phone → Claude edits the HTML + deploys (~5 sec).
Without Claude Code: edit HTML manually and run `npx netlify deploy` (~15 sec).
